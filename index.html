    <div>My Dear Students,</div>
<p id="message">Education is a social process.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"> Education</a> is growth. Education is, not a preparation for life; education is life itself. Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902), a great thinker and reformer of our country, embraced education, which for him signified ‘man- making’, as the very mission of his life. To quote him: 'Education is not the amount of information that is put into your brain and runs riot there undigested, all your life.' Education for him
 means that process by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, and intellect is sharpened, as a result of which one can stand on one’s own feet.</p>
